# Stone-paper-Scissor-game
It is a Stone 🗿-paper 📰-Scissor ✂  Console game . It is an example project on procedural programming using C++ 👩‍💻 . It asks you about the number of rounds you want to play (It must be from 1 to 10) then you have to choose stone , paper or scissor . After that computer chooses randomly . The program shows your choice , computer's choice and who wins in this round . if you win , it will turn screen into green, but if  computer wins , it will turn screen into red and make an alert. if your choices are the same , it will turn screen yellow . Finally , It will display the Final winner through all the rounds , how many rounds you won ,  how many rounds computer won and  how many rounds  drawn . I hope you enjoy the game.
